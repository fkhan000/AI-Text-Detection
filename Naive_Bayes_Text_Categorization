## Instructions on Running Program

I developed my system in version 12.3.1 of the macOS Monterey operating system. To run the program you need python 3.9.12 or a
later version installed. You will also need to install the following libraries in order to run the program: pandas, numpy, sklearn,
and nltk. Finally, to run the program, place the program in the same directory that the training and testing documents are in.
After that, go onto the terminal and cd into that directory and enter the following command: python3 Khan_F_ECE_467_Project1.py.
The program will prompt you to enter in the path to the file that contains the list of training documents as well as the path to
the file containing the list of testing documents. After you enter those paths in, the program will begin training on the
training set that you have provided. Once it finishes training , it will prompt you for the name of the output file that you would
like the classifications to be written in.
